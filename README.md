<h1>Hello<h1>
<p>
Welcome to my Portfolio Project for MITxPro. I built this website to show case my experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I used Bootstrap Modal as a popup in the CONTACT page. A link to the Bootstrap links and code is available in the Bootstrap folder</li>
  <li>Grid and flex were used for layout. Custom classes and layouts were created for the website</li>
  <li> I used different CSS techniques to add interest and styling to my page with hover effects, navigation crumbs, and span styling</li>
  <li> I usede a bit of animation and movement for interactive items </li>
  <li> Javascript was used to add interactivity to clickable page items</li>
  <li>I also used media query and custom classes to make the website responsive and ease of maintainance of the website</l>
</ul>
<br />
<p> Please feel free to look into the code and contact me if you have any questions abouthow things work</p>
