<h1>Hello<h1>
<p>
Welcome to my Portfolio Project for MITxPro. I built this website to show case my experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript. I used Bootstrap Modal as a
popup, CSS grid and flex for layout. I used animation and movement to add styling to the website. I also used media querry and custom classes to maintain the website.
</p>
<p> Please feel free to look into the code and contact me if you have any qyuestions how things work</p>
