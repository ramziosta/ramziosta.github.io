<h1>Hello<h1>
<p>
Welcome to my Portfolio Project for MITxPro. I built this website to show case my experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I used Bootstrap Modal as a popup in the CONTACT page. A link to the Bootstrap links and code is available in the Bootstrap folder</li>
  <li>I used Bootstrap Card to link to my Codepen Projects. A link to the Bootstrap links and code is available in the Bootstrap folder</li>
  <li>Grid and flex were used for layout. Custom classes for font, color and layouts were created for the website</li>
  <li> I used different CSS techniques to add interest and styling to my page with hover effects, navigation crumbs, and span styling</li>
  <li> I usede a bit of animation and movement for interactive items </li>
  <li> Javascript was used to add interactivity to clickable page items and to hide the picture and video on home page. These two elements were not supposed to be on the main page but requierment of the course. They will be re/or moved to a the about me page </li>
  <li>I also used media query and custom classes to make the website responsive and easy to maintain or update</l>
</ul>
<br />
<p> Please feel free to look into the code and contact me if you have any questions abouthow things work</p>
